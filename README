This project is an attempt to make a simple way to share GPS logs with other
people.

I have a large number of logs, and ways to display an manipulate them using
local tools, but sharing them with other people has always been a little
awkward.  What I would like is a small HTML template that I can use to load
a GPX file and display it with a slippy map - this project now provides me
with this feature.

Using OpenLayers and OpenStreetMap, the test.html file provides a simple
example of how to load a GPX map.

Future goals are:
* Load and display geo-referenced photos
* Get smart with zoom levels and tiling to load different resolution GPX files
  (and thus avoid massive delays while multi-meg files are loaded)
* Improve the "loading"/"Finished" user interface
* Load multiple GPX files simultaneously (with optional end-user friendly
  names - not just URLs) and allow user to toggle which ones are
  currently visible
